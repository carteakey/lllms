# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Winamp-classic skin for the Rust TUI (0.8.0): new `src/theme.rs` palette module — playlist green (#00FF00) body text on black, dim-green borders/titles, classic dark-blue (#0000C6) selection bars with white bold rows, amber accents/warnings, red errors, and an inverted LED badge style (black-on-green) for the header logo, footer status bar, and focused download fields. All inline `Color::Cyan`/`Yellow`/`DarkGray` styling in `src/app.rs` (34 sites, 27 blocks) rewired through the theme helpers; chat user lines render amber and assistant lines playlist green.

### Changed
- Model inventory reconciliation (2026-08-31 storage cleanup follow-up), via `codex-skills/model-inventory-manager`: 11 serving entries referencing deleted files commented out of `llama-swap.yaml` (gpt-oss-120b ×3, qwen3-coder-next ×3, nomic-embed, qwen3-6-mtp + vision, gemma-4-26b-qat-mtp-vision, sarvam-30b; pre-edit snapshot `llama-swap.yaml.bak-20260831-<ts>`); 7 orphan files deleted (~24 GB — Ridge 3.7bpw 13 GB superseded by IQ3_XXS, 4 spare qwen38 MTP heads, unsloth Qwen3.8 MTP head dir, gemma QAT Q8_0 head). Audit script fixed: model store path fell back from the dead `/mnt/lab/models` mount to `/home/kchauhan/models`, sharded-GGUF false orphans (a served `-00001-of-N` shard now covers its set), `--spec-draft-model` path extraction, and media models (MiniMax/HeartMuLa/LTX) excluded per the skill's preservation rules. Router restarted clean with 7 active models (`/v1/models` verified).
- Dashboard (l3ms.carteakey.dev) restored to regenerable state and history preserved: `docs/dashboard-meta.json` was stale (generator hard-failed — missing qwen3.8 family + qwen3-8-27b, still listing the retired gemma-4-12b trio). Active set now matches the 7 served entries exactly (added qwen38-flash-next gold/exp/MTP with the internal-doc measurement ledger as evidence fields, and qwen3-8-27b-iq3-xxs @ 262k); 11 retired profiles moved to the `archived` section **with their last measured tps preserved** (gemma-12b 120.8, QCN 39.6, gpt-oss-120b 28.5, Qwen3.6 Q4 60.3, Gemma vision 39.0, Sarvam 15.0); system block corrected to 64 GB DDR5 @ 5000 MT/s; `index.html` archive card now renders tps/quant/profiles with an explicit "archived numbers are not reproducible" caveat; generator + tests pass, `generated-models.js` regenerated.
- Bench docs split (was a 1260-line `docs/bench-runbook.md`, now three docs with verified no-loss migration — all 939 non-blank source lines accounted for, 934 verbatim, 5 justified rewordings: two "section above" → explicit doc reference after the move, three headings re-leveled under the new structure; a stray unclosed ` ``` ` fence artifact at EOF was dropped):
  - `docs/bench-runbook.md` (639 lines): operational core only — overview, prerequisites, system-state check, CPU power layering, script layout, experiment sequence, reading results, known constraints, adding a new model, generic quick reference.
  - `docs/bench-results.md` (new, 521 lines): per-model measured results (Qwen3-Coder-Next, Gemma-4-26B-A4B stub, Gemma/Qwen3.6 MTP, Qwen3.6-35B, Qwen3.5-122B, gpt-oss-120b), per-model quickstarts, winner cheatsheet, KV cache quant recommendation. This is where `/add-bench-result` writes now.
  - `docs/bench-troubleshooting.md` (new, 152 lines): tg-variability root cause, archived 22-item checklist, common troubleshooting table, GGML CUDA memory pools (VMM growth, fit headroom, mid-session OOM fixes).
  - Cross-references updated in: `llama-swap.yaml` model descriptions (§8 → `docs/bench-results.md`; pre-edit snapshot `llama-swap.yaml.bak-20260831-203159`), `.claude/commands/{add-bench-result,new-model-config,model-status,bench-model,optimize-model}.md`, `docs/model-onboarding-playbook.md`, `docs/qwen38-flash-next-internal.md`. `.bak-*` snapshots and `thread.md` transcript left untouched (historical record).
- Bench runbook: added a "CPU power layering" section (docs/bench-runbook.md) disentangling governor vs EPP vs HWP vs profile managers — on `intel_pstate` the governor name is mostly a label and EPP is the knob that matters (`powersave` + EPP=performance is a valid high-perf setup); Tuned is not a CachyOS default (PPD is; tuned-ppd is the shim bridging them) and its `throughput-performance` profile is functionally equivalent to the manual setup; I/O scheduler noted as an unrelated block layer. Recorded current box state (2026-08-31): PPD 0.30 active at `performance` profile, tuned/tuned-ppd not installed (tuned-ppd swap reverted), governor/EPP=performance verified live; added a status-update note to the historical root-cause section.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-31

The Rust port remains in progress under `CAR-97`; these entries describe
implemented slices and do not assert full legacy parity or a fully green
verification matrix.

### Added
- CPU power profile switched to `performance` on the serving box and documented (`docs/qwen38-flash-next-internal.md` §5/§9.4): ~+3% on the ngram-mod spec-warm path (25.7-26.3 vs 24.8-25.4 t/s — ramp penalty between speculative verify rounds), neutral on sustained prose (19.5 t/s floor unchanged, memory-latency bound). Reboot checklist gained a governor-verification step; internal doc also records that a single cold speculation-pool reading is pool state, not a regression.
- Three-tier qwen3.8-flash-next layout (gold = master, exp = stack, MTP = exp+MTP), all smoke-tested through the router (content "OK", reasoning intact): `qwen38-flash-next` now runs plain upstream master (`vendor/llama.cpp-master`, 85c55223c — dedicated clone; the shared `vendor/llama.cpp` is a stale bisect checkout and was left untouched); new `qwen38-flash-next-exp` entry runs the exp stack (e1748dbd5) as `build/bin/llama-server-exp`; `qwen38-flash-next-mtp` rebuilt as exp+MTP (0b7d6d57d) by cleanly merging #27836 onto the stack and finally committing the previously-uncommitted 57-line detached-head patch from the pr-test-27836 working tree (saved at /tmp and applied; that clone is now obsolete). Flag rename applied everywhere on master-based builds (`--tensor-read-lazy` → `--lazy-mode on`); the A/B bench harness updated to prod=master vs stack=exp. Maintenance note: the stack clone's `build/bin/llama-server` is the MTP binary and `build/bin/llama-server-exp` the exp binary — branch switches in that clone require rebuilding both.
- Unsloth-quant evaluation for Qwen3.8-Flash-Next, concluded without adopting (bench-models/bench-llama-qwen38-flash-next-build-ab.sh repurposed as a binary A/B harness): remote-parsed UD-IQ4_XS and UD-Q4_K_XL shard headers (PLE = 29.8 GiB at ~4.7 bpw in both; non-PLE weights 62.5 GiB / 74.7 GiB) and cross-checked KLD tables — UD-IQ4_XS (0.0836) is a lateral move vs AtomicChat AD-4.27bpw (0.0842), and the only quality step up (UD-Q4_K_XL, 0.0469) needs ~78 GiB fast memory vs ~72 GB available (60 RAM + 12 VRAM), leaving zero headroom for long-conversation KV growth, so expert paging would degrade decode (the exact Reddit failure mode). The `-ot "per_layer_token_embd\.weight=CPU"` + mmap technique (replicates AtomicChat's separate-shard PLE offload on unsloth quants; mmap is load-bearing) is documented here for a future bigger-RAM box. Dangling router entry removed; no unsloth download retained.
- PR-stack test build for Qwen3.8-Flash-Next (`vendor/llama.cpp-pr-test-28023-28068-27941`, built with `maintenance/llama-test-pr.sh` convention): current master (qwen4exp is upstream now; TENSOR_READ_LAZY landed via #27794 so production flags are safe) + #28023 (indexer heads summed by slices, approved) + #28068 (GDN l2norm max→rsqrt correctness fix across delta-net models) + #27941 (kvu NaN-collapse + indexer restore fixes; test-file conflict vs master's newer test suite resolved by taking master's side — test file is not in our build targets). To be A/B'd against the production pr-test-27742 binary via `bench-models/bench-llama-qwen38-flash-next-build-ab.sh`; #27977 (tg slowdown as ctx grows) and #27992 (O(log n) n-gram lookups) deferred to a second stack.
- Binary A/B run (`bench-llama-qwen38-flash-next-build-ab.sh`, AtomicChat AD-4.27bpw, fit64, 64k, q8 KV, ngram-mod spec): production pr-test-27742 (tg 25.0/25.4, hot pp 198) vs master+stack e1748dbd5 (tg 25.1/20.2, hot pp 200) — speed is a wash within noise; the stack's value is correctness (#28068 GDN l2norm, #27941 NaN-collapse/restore fixes). Note for future stacks: upstream renamed `--tensor-read-lazy` to `--lazy-mode on|auto|off`, and qwen4exp itself is upstream via the #27742 squash merge (6c84c7d5d), so PR-branch vendoring is only needed for PRs not yet merged. Router restarted after the full-VRAM experiment. Production macro swap pending a long-context tg probe and/or quality sign-off.
- Production swap: `qwen38_server` macro now points at the PR-stack build (`pr-test-28023-28068-27941`, e1748dbd5) and the `qwen38-flash-next` entry's `--tensor-read-lazy on` became `--lazy-mode on` (upstream flag rename; the pr-27836 MTP build keeps the old flag and is untouched — gold still speculates with ngram-mod only, no MTP). tg-variance follow-up on the stack build: fresh-load tg 13.3 → 15.2 → 24.4 → 24.8 → 24.8 t/s — the A/B dips were the ngram-mod pool warm-up transient, not a regression; steady state 24.8 t/s ≈ prod 25.0-25.4, hot pp 200 ≈ 198. SIGHUP + router smoke test passed (content "OK", reasoning trace intact). Rollback: restore `pr-test-27742` macro from `llama-swap.yaml.bak-*`.
- Prefill (pp) investigation for Qwen3.8-Flash-Next (`bench-llama-qwen38-flash-next-pp.sh`): first prompt after model load pays ~7.5 s of expert-page NVMe fault-in (SN770 Gen4, ~6 GB/s); repeat prompts hit KV prefix reuse (prompt_n collapses — bench probe fixed to force full prefill and print prompt_n); true warm full-prefill pp measured at ~200 t/s (fit-on, 64k, THP=always) on a fresh quiet boot. THP=always + `defrag=defer+madvise` kept (neutral-to-positive). Also added `maintenance/gguf_tensor_types.py` (pure-python GGUF tensor-type dump) after finding the AtomicChat file's routed experts are actually IQ2_XS + Q2_K_S.
- Attribution 2×2 for Qwen3.8-Flash-Next (`bench-llama-qwen38-flash-next-graphopt.sh`): `GGML_CUDA_GRAPH_OPT=1` is a no-op on current master (graphs already reused without it); `--fit on --fit-target 512` gives +2.8% tg over `-ncmoe 46` at 64k — base router entry switched to fit-on. Warm ngram-mod pool measured at 18.9 → 35.9 t/s (+90%) on repeated identical prompts; novel-content decode ~20 t/s.
- Benchmarked Qwen3.8-Flash-Next MTP via llama.cpp PR #27836 (+ detached-head patch): sidecar Q4_K_M draft head (requantized from Q8_0) fits 12 GB VRAM at 32k ctx. Ungated dn=2 is net-negative (prose −12..−22%); with `--spec-draft-p-min 0.7` gating code tg +15..26% at prose parity, acceptance 0.81–0.97. Wired as a separate `qwen38-flash-next-mtp` router entry (32k ctx cap) plus `bench-models/bench-llama-qwen38-flash-next-mtp.sh` A/B harness.
- Benchmarked Gemma 4 26B QAT (UD-Q4_K_XL) with external MTP drafter: tg 69.1 t/s (vs 45.03 no-MTP fit, ~1.5x). Placement derived via llama-fit-params (fit with external draft loops in 571d0d5). Logged in `bench-models/logs/results/gemma-4-26b-qat-mtp.jsonl`; runbook §8 updated.
- Benchmarked Qwen3.6-35B-A3B UD-Q6_K with self-drafted MTP (`--spec-type draft-mtp --spec-draft-p-min 0.75 --spec-draft-n-max 2`): tg 51.3 t/s (vs 26.92 no-MTP fit, ~1.9x). Logged in `bench-models/logs/results/qwen3-6-mtp-q6.jsonl`; runbook §8 updated.
- Added a bounded benchmark result browser with JSONL/Markdown parsing,
  deterministic sorting, and `--compare-results` metric diffs.
- Added persisted operator settings, atomic non-secret profile import/export,
  and a bounded Chat system-prompt library with a TUI picker.
- Added paged model inventories, Hugging Face progress/ETA feedback, optional
  shellcheck-on-save diagnostics, serving/bench flag drift checks, and a safe
  explicit action to stop a freshly detected external llama-server.
- Added disk-free and network byte counters to runtime telemetry.
- Added `maintenance/run-l3ms-kpc.sh` to launch the deployed Rust binary with
  the existing KPC llama-swap service and downloader environment.
- Added the initial Rust `0.7.0` application: a Clap launcher, authenticated
  llama-swap client, typed configuration/script stores, and seven-view Ratatui
  workbench.
- Added atomic, collision-safe configuration and script snapshots with strict
  validation, traversal protection, runtime-root-aware storage, and Unix mode
  preservation.
- Added supervised bench, download, and maintenance processes with bounded
  output, in-session jobs, and process-group shutdown.
- Added streamed chat with bounded SSE parsing, system/temperature/token and
  thinking controls, token-rate feedback, and authenticated requests.
- Added a typed command registry, executable `Ctrl+P` palette, and contextual
  help generated from the same command metadata.
- Added live process-tree CPU/RAM telemetry with optional NVIDIA memory
  reporting.
- Added tested standalone modules for bounded GGUF v2/v3 metadata parsing and
  legacy-compatible atomic job/chat-session persistence.
- Added reusable bench, maintenance, and download editor state with validation,
  dirty tracking, safe selection, and snapshot save/reload/restore operations.
- Added inline UTF-8 bench and maintenance script editors with persistent
  viewports, dirty-change guards, snapshot browsing, and explicit save/reload
  controls.
- Added the current keyboard-driven Download editor surface: config-path and
  runtime controls, model CRUD and all typed fields, validation, atomic save,
  snapshot restore, dedicated logs, disk-space feedback, and supervised
  selected/enabled launches.
- Added a schema-versioned Hugging Face dry-run estimator and a strict Rust
  preflight boundary with bounded output, timeout/cancellation, child cleanup,
  cache-aware byte totals, and platform-aware target disk probing.
- Added a reusable Unicode-safe text buffer with character-boundary editing,
  terminal-cell cursor positioning, and vertical/page navigation.
- Added a pinned Rust toolchain, locked dependencies, unit coverage, strict
  Clippy checks, and GitHub Actions verification.
- Added an on-demand `nomic-embed-text-v1.5` llama-swap profile with
  authenticated `/v1/embeddings` routing and a five-minute idle unload TTL.
- Added an enabled targeted downloader profile and embedding deployment checks.
- Added Rust Chat endpoint editing, authenticated Connect/Detect, independent
  model selection, request-ID guarded streaming, and responsive cancellation.
- Added declarative media-generation profiles and an argv-safe `--media` CLI
  for MiniMax-H3 and HeartMuLa through audio.cpp plus the LTX-2.5
  DistilledPipeline.
- Added Yeti-focused media setup and readiness checks, including the audio.cpp
  MiniMax-H3 Q4_K and HeartMuLa Q8_0 installers plus the gated LTX-2.5
  bootstrap.
- Added explicit still-image conditioning to the LTX-2.5 media profile while
  keeping H3's audio.cpp input surface text-first and shell-safe.
- Documented LTX-2.5 quantization compatibility: BF16 plus runtime FP8 for
  the Ada Yeti target, rather than the ComfyUI-only INT8 or Blackwell-only
  NVFP4 files.
- Added prompt-file inputs and playable MP4 muxing for H3 video output when
  the host provides ffmpeg, while retaining the raw RGB24 artifact for
  inspection and recovery.
- Added a local HeartMuLa music profile through audio.cpp using the published
  Q8_0 GGUF package, with prompt/tag, lyrics-file, instrumental, duration, and
  memory-saver controls.
- Added an explicit LTX-2.5 transformer checkpoint override so a future
  loader-compatible pre-quantized artifact can be selected without changing
  the wrapper.

- Added a reproducibility evidence record to every published local profile,
  including explicit historical gaps for PP, tested context, cache state,
  draft acceptance, llama.cpp commit, and benchmark command.
- Added a validated community-run schema, submission guide, generator tests,
  and a separate unranked dashboard view for non-local hardware.
- Added keyboard and palette-backed Bench script filtering with stable editor
  and run selection mapping plus an explicit no-results state.

### Changed
- Kept community runs structurally separate from the local RTX 4070 ranking
  and updated the dashboard methodology to make that boundary visible.
- `qwen38-flash-next` router entry now caps thinking by default: `--reasoning-effort medium --reasoning-budget 4000 --reasoning-preserve` (Qwen3.8 ships xhigh thinking; the cap trades a small quality delta for large effective-throughput gains in agentic use).
- Made the Rust launcher use llama-swap for `--run` and `--list run`, while
  preserving `bench-*.sh` files as the benchmark entry points and retaining the
  Python downloader as a compatibility child process.
- Made media prompts, lyrics, and output paths travel through a shell-free
  process boundary; media runtime scripts remain the editable upstream-facing
  layer.
- Replaced the hosted MiniMax Music/mmx profile with offline HeartMuLa Q8_0
  generation through the same pinned audio.cpp CUDA runtime used by H3.
- Connected jobs and chat sessions to their legacy-compatible persistent state,
  including stale-job reconciliation, bounded history, safe retry reconstruction,
  and saved-session browsing.
- Replaced the Rust GGUF view's filename-only inventory with bounded metadata
  scanning, recursive/top-level modes, filtering, deterministic sorting, file
  details, and per-file parse warnings.
- Made explicit global download workers override per-model workers, with the
  per-model value taking precedence over the slow preset when no global value
  is supplied.
- Made Rust downloader launches construct argv without a shell and select
  Python from `L3MS_DOWNLOADER_PYTHON`, the platform repository venv, or
  `python3`, in that order. The downloader script now has a portable
  `#!/usr/bin/env python3` shebang for direct CLI use.
- Made Download launches preflight the immutable selected/enabled command off
  the rendering thread, report cached/remaining size against free space, allow
  `Esc` cancellation, and preserve legacy launch behavior when estimation is
  unavailable.
- Made the Download view responsive across wide, compact, and focused-pane
  terminal layouts while keeping the active field and cursor visible.
- Isolated new Download histories with stable path-hashed snapshot namespaces
  while retaining list and restore compatibility with legacy snapshot
  directories.
- Added repeat-action confirmation before dirty Download reload or restore, and
  reported post-operation snapshot-list failures as secondary warnings rather
  than failures of completed load, save, or restore operations.

### Fixed
- Treat llama-swap load and unload HTTP failures as failed operations instead
  of successful jobs.
- Correct selected-download handling for multiple allow/ignore patterns and
  `base_models_dir`.
- Validate Download snapshots before mutation and save the exact displaced
  config bytes as an undo snapshot before atomic restore, preventing invalid or
  non-undoable replacements and the post-restore disk/memory split-brain window.
- Prevent dirty-quit confirmation from being hidden behind the command palette
  and prevent large-script cursor placement from disagreeing with Ratatui's
  rendered scroll window.
- Apply batch download slow/global worker controls when normalized model rows
  contain `max_workers: null`.
- Prevent synchronous disk probing and stale preflight events from blocking or
  mutating the active Download view, and reap canceled estimator descendants on
  Unix even when they retain inherited output pipes.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- Added a Workbench-first llama-swap launcher with live model filtering, load,
  unload, chat, bench, browser, download, and jobs actions on the first screen.
- Added `LLAMA_SWAP_API_KEY` support for authenticated llama-swap model and
  chat requests.

### Changed
- Replaced the static Start hub with the Workbench tab as the default entry
  point.
- Routed Workbench model loads through Model Ops so job history and resource
  telemetry stay consistent.
- Reordered top-level shortcuts around the fast path: F1 Workbench, F2 Ops,
  F3 Chat, F4 Browser, F5 Download, F6 Jobs, F7 Maintenance.
- Simplified Model Ops run mode by hiding bench-only binary, extra-args,
  version, and script-save controls until bench mode is active.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- Added `maintenance/systemd/nanobot-gateway.service` to manage and run the
  `nanobot gateway` command persistently.
- Added `maintenance/setup-nanobot-gateway-service.sh` to install, start,
  stop, restart, enable, disable, and monitor the gateway service.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- Added a machine-testing handoff for n-gram speculation, target/draft KV precision, CUDA graphs, ubatch sizing, prompt-cache reuse, imatrix quants, and future multi-GPU work.

### Changed
- Removed the inactive `LLAMA_SET_ROWS` environment variable from current serving profiles, benchmark scripts, and Windows launchers, then regenerated the dashboard commands.
- Marked its appearance in an older benchmark result as historical context rather than an active recommendation.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-06-21

### Fixed
- Corrected the dashboard test GPU from RTX 4070 Super 12GB to RTX 4070 12GB.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added
- Expandable served-profile details with portable, copyable `llama-server`
  commands generated from `llama-swap.yaml`.
- Direct links from each profile to its serving config and benchmark source.
- A compact methodology note explaining the difference between profile-level
  throughput and task-level MTP benchmark runs.
- CI validation that rejects stale generated dashboard data.

### Changed
- Rebuilt the public dashboard around generated data instead of a handwritten
  duplicate of the active model catalog.
- Replaced the static online indicator with an honest dated profile snapshot.
- Sorted profile rankings by measured TG and corrected ranks 10–12.
- Replaced the crushed mobile table with stacked model cards and expandable
  command details.
- Clarified benchmark descriptions where headline and task-level measurements
  come from separate runs.

### [2026-06-16]
- **Qwen 3.6 MTP Optimization & Cleanup**:
  - Benchmarked Qwen 3.6 35B MTP configurations on RTX 4070 (`UD-Q4_K_XL` and `UD-Q6_K` variants).
  - Aligned `llama-swap.yaml` and benching scripts with optimal `spec-draft-n-max` parameters (n-max=2 for `UD-Q4_K_XL` yielding **60.3 tok/s**; n-max=2 for `UD-Q6_K` yielding **43.1 tok/s**).
  - Fixed hanging issue in `bench-llama-qwen3-6-reddit-baseline.sh` and `bench-ik-qwen3-6-reddit-test.sh` by adding `-st` (single-turn) flag.
  - Evaluated `nothink` variants (`enable_thinking: false`) and confirmed they generate slightly slower (**58.0 tok/s** on Q4; **40.9 tok/s** on Q6) due to less structured output reducing speculative decoding acceptance rates compared to thinking mode.
  - Safely archived (took version snapshots of) and removed 5 obsolete non-MTP Qwen3.6 bench and run scripts from the codebase.
  - Removed the obsolete `unsloth/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-GGUF` model download profile from `models_config.json`.

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog, and this project follows Semantic Versioning.

### [2026-06-12]
- **Gemma 4 QAT & MTP Integration**:
  - Rebuilt mainline `llama.cpp` using the system GCC 16 compiler to resolve segmentation faults in CUDA template compilation.
  - Added new Gemma 4 26B and 12B QAT & MTP profiles to `llama-swap.yaml` (`gemma-4-26b-qat`, `gemma-4-26b-qat-mtp`, `gemma-4-12b-qat`, `gemma-4-12b-qat-mtp`).
  - Deprecated and removed the older, redundant non-QAT Gemma 4 26B profiles (`gemma-4-26b-a4b`, `gemma-4-26b-a4b-vision`, `gemma-4-26b-mtp`, `gemma-4-26b-mtp-vision`, `gemma-4-26b-a4b-q6-k-xl`, and `gemma-4-26b-mtp-q6`) as the new QAT + MTP configurations fully replace them at double the speed.
  - Created blog posts documenting benchmarks for Gemma 4 26B and 12B under QAT and MTP configurations, showing local speeds up to 100.6 tok/s (26B) and 120.8 tok/s (12B) on an RTX 4070.
- **TPS Leaderboard & Dashboard**:
  - Implemented a premium, glassmorphism-based static HTML dashboard (`docs/index.html`) served as a GitHub Page to showcase currently active/served models, performance ranges across tasks, and archived/deprecated models.

### [2026-05-19]
- **MTP Improvements**: Rebuilt `llama.cpp` with [PR #23269](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/23269) for enhanced Multi-Token Prediction performance.
- **Qwen 3.6 35B**: Added Q6_K variant and initialized benchmarking to evaluate performance vs Q4_K_XL.
- **Documentation**: Updated MTP-related posts with latest upstream status.


### Changed
- **Qwen 3.6 MTP Mainline**: Updated `llama-swap.yaml` configuration to use the mainline `llama-server` and the updated `--spec-type draft-mtp` flag since MTP support is now merged into `llama.cpp` master.
- **TUI workbench pass**:
  - Added a persistent command bar with context-specific shortcut hints.
  - Reworked the Start tab into a compact workbench hub grouped around
    Operate / Inventory / Command flows.
  - Upgraded the command palette with a shortcut column and token-based
    filtering.
  - Reduced Run/Model Ops table churn by avoiding column rebuilds on every
    filter refresh.
  - Moved repeated shortcut hint rows into a reusable `ShortcutStrip`.
  - Moved llama-swap model refresh onto a named Textual worker and refresh the
    command bar on direct tab activation.
- **Maintenance updater**: new `maintenance/update-llama-stack.sh` snapshots
  the current llama-swap binary and llama.cpp build metadata, updates
  llama-swap, rebuilds mainline llama.cpp, validates `llama-swap.yaml`, and
  restarts `llama-swap.service` only if it was already active.
- **llama.cpp build script**: dropped the removed `llama-sweep-bench` target
  from the default build target list.
- **Bench result logging**: fixed fitted `-ot "..."` placement strings so
  `bench-models/log-result.sh` records JSONL results instead of tripping over
  shell quotes. Structured results now live under `bench-models/logs/results/`
  alongside the raw bench logs.
- **Codex skill**: added `codex-skills/l3ms-prepost` for repeatable
  before/update/after llama-swap + llama.cpp maintenance checks.
- **Serving architecture switched to llama-swap**:
  - New `llama-swap.yaml` is the single source of truth for every servable
    model (28 previous `run-models/*.sh` scripts collapsed into YAML entries
    + aliases + reasoning-effort variants).
  - New `maintenance/systemd/llama-swap.service` user-level unit runs
    `llama-swap -config llama-swap.yaml -listen :8080`.
  - Startup preload is `gemma-4-26b-a4b-vision` (previously the dedicated
    `gemma-vision.service` default).
  - New `docs/llama-swap-runbook.md` covers install, start/stop, curl,
    and how to add a model.
  - **Breaking**: `run-models/` directory removed. Clients previously hitting
    per-model ports (mostly `:8001`) now hit the single `:8080` endpoint and
    pass the model ID in the OpenAI `model` field. Update the TUI Chat tab's
    base URL to `http://<host>:8080/v1`.
- **TUI Model Ops Run mode now talks to llama-swap**:
  - New `l3ms/llama_swap.py` HTTP client (`list_models`, `load_model`,
    `unload_model`, `probe`). `LLAMA_SWAP_URL` env override supported.
  - Run mode table lists models from `/v1/models` (with state column).
    Start (`Ctrl+R`) calls `POST /models/load`; Stop (`Ctrl+S`) calls
    `POST /models/unload`. Editor becomes a read-only detail pane with
    ready-to-copy curl snippets.
  - Bench mode is unchanged: still globs `bench-models/*.sh` and spawns
    subprocesses.
  - Jobs tab retry: for `run` mode, retries now resolve as model IDs
    (not script paths).
  - `l3ms.py --run`: picks a model from llama-swap and POSTs `/models/load`.
    `l3ms.py --list run`: prints models from `/v1/models`.
- **Installer**: `maintenance/install-llama-swap.sh` fetches the release
  binary into `~/bin/` with OS/arch auto-detection and `FORCE` / version
  pinning. Replaces the copy-paste curl snippet in the runbook.

- **Polish pass on the migration**:
  - Fix `--fit-ctx 32678` → `32768` typo in `gpt-oss-120b-legacy` and
    `gpt-oss-120b-low` (copied verbatim from the original shell scripts).
  - Switch `ik-qwen3-5-122b-thinking-coding` to `${ik_server}` (the original
    ik- shell script used the vanilla binary — required the ik fork for
    `-merge-qkv`).
  - `llama-swap.service` now uses `%h` + env vars (`L3MS_ROOT`,
    `LLAMA_SWAP_BIN`, `LLAMA_SWAP_LISTEN`) so the unit runs unmodified on any
    account; documented drop-in override flow in the runbook.
  - RunPanel in run mode now tracks `loaded_model_id` separately from the
    cursor; Ctrl+S unloads the model that's actually loaded, not whatever
    row the user last clicked. Friendly message when nothing is loaded.
  - Run-mode live resource telemetry restored: `_find_llama_swap_pid` +
    `ps --ppid` aggregate CPU/RAM of llama-swap upstream processes, polled
    every 2s. `nvidia-smi` still feeds the GPU column when available.
  - ChatPanel: replaced the read-only model label with a `Select` populated
    from `/v1/models` on connect/detect; requests use the selected model ID
    instead of the hard-coded `"default"` string (which llama-swap rejects).
  - Jobs-tab retry for run mode now carries the model ID through
    `JobStarted.script_path` so "retry" reloads the right model.
- **`gemma-vision.service` retired**:
  - Unit moved to `maintenance/systemd/archive/gemma-vision.service`.
  - Installer helper moved to
    `maintenance/archive/setup-gemma-vision-service.sh`.
  - `maintenance/archive/README.md` explains the migration + disable steps.
  - `docs/bench-runbook.md` no longer documents that flow.

- **Qwen3.5-122B-A10B bench suite**: `bench-llama-cpp-qwen3-5-122b-a10b.sh`, `bench-llama-cpp-qwen3-5-122b-a10b-strategies.sh`, `bench-llama-cpp-qwen3-5-122b-a10b-fit.sh`, `bench-ik-llama-cpp-qwen3-5-122b-a10b.sh` — full bench coverage; documents shared-expert `(ch|)exps` pattern gotcha
- **`run-llama-cpp-gpt-oss-120b-optimized.sh`**: optimized server run script with static `-ngl 37 --override-tensor` (fit-derived), `--parallel 1`, explicit `--ctx-size 32768`; drops `--fit` startup overhead; confirmed +540 MiB more model weight on GPU and 28 t/s tg vs 27 t/s with original script
- **`maintenance/build-llama-cpp-cublas.sh`**: builds llama.cpp with `GGML_CUDA_FORCE_CUBLAS=ON` + `GGML_CUDA_FORCE_DMMV=OFF` into a separate `build-cublas/` dir; tested against gpt-oss-120b, found slower than default build (GGML MMQ mxfp4 kernel wins at decode-batch sizes)

- **Command palette** (`Ctrl+P`): fuzzy-filtered `CommandPaletteScreen` modal lists every app action; type to narrow, Enter to run, Esc to cancel
- **Jobs tab stop + retry**: `■ Stop Running` and `↺ Retry Selected` buttons added to Jobs panel; running job shown with `▶` indicator; `s` / `r` key shortcuts when Jobs tab is active; `StopRequest` / `RetryRequest` messages routed through `L3MSApp` to `RunPanel`; `script_path` and `mode` now persisted in job history for reliable retry
- **Chat history persistence**: `save_chat` now writes both `.md` (human-readable) and `.json` (machine-loadable) to `~/.l3ms/chats/`; new `Sessions` / `Load` buttons open `ChatHistoryScreen` modal to browse and restore saved sessions
- **Graceful shutdown** (`action_quit`): on `q`, all running subprocesses are `terminate()`d and async resource/task loops are cancelled before exit — no more orphaned `llama-server` processes on quit
- `run-llama-cpp-nemotron-super-120b.sh`: run script for NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Super 120B-A12B UD-Q3_K_XL (latent-MoE, 12B active params, port 8001, ctx 32768)
- `NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-GGUF` UD-Q3_K_XL entry added to `models_config.json` (~62.6 GB, 3 split shards, enabled)

  - `run-models/run-llama-cpp-mistral-small-4-119b.sh` standard fit-based server script (safe defaults)
  - `run-models/run-llama-cpp-mistral-small-4-119b-optimized.sh` throughput-oriented static-placement script (`-ngl`, `--override-tensor`, `q8_0` KV, `--parallel 1`)
  - `run-models/run-llama-cpp-mistral-small-4-119b-optimized-no-vision.sh` explicit non-vision optimized preset (same tuned defaults as current non-vision path)
  - `run-models/run-llama-cpp-mistral-small-4-119b-optimized-vision.sh` explicit vision optimized preset with `--mmproj` and one fewer GPU layer by default (`-ngl 8`)
  - `bench-models/bench-llama-cpp-mistral-small-4-119b-strategies.sh` strategy sweep script that compares tg across offload presets and reports the best strategy
- **Bench + run script expansion**:
  - Added model-specific strategy/fit benches for Nemotron 120B, Qwen3.5-122B-A10B, Sarvam 30B, and gpt-oss-120B under `bench-models/`
  - Added optimized launch presets `run-llama-cpp-qwen3-coder-next-optimized.sh` and `run-llama-cpp-mistral-small-4-119b-optimized-no-vision-thinking.sh`
  - Added `preflight-check.sh` and maintenance helpers (`llama-sweep.sh`, `llama-test-pr.sh`) for repeatable local validation workflows
- **Docs additions**:
  - Added `docs/vibe_configuration.md` and expanded bench/run workflow guidance for current local model ops

### Fixed
- `MarkupError` crash in `refresh_disk_space`: paths like `/home/user` inside `[…]` were parsed as Rich closing tags; fixed by passing the full `[path]` token through `markup_escape()`
- **Maintenance tab output capture**: `run_script` no longer `await`s its own task — script output now streams live to `maint_log` without blocking the event loop
- `on_run_panel_job_started` and `on_run_panel_job_finished` now forward `mode` correctly to `JobsPanel`
- `ctrl+p` remapped from `run_save_script` (moved to `alt+p`) to `show_command_palette` for consistency with editor convention

- Launcher CLI interactive modes: `--run`, `--bench`, `--list`, `--extra`
- Model Ops runtime status with current model and resource telemetry
- Keyboard-first action scoping to active tab to prevent unwanted tab switching
- Project docs set: `TODO.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and app description updates
