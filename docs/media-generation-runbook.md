# Media generation runbook

L3MS exposes media generation as an explicit, script-first CLI surface. The
registry in [`media-runtimes.json`](../media-runtimes.json) is the discoverable
source of truth; the executable wrappers in `media-models/` keep each upstream
runtime's flags and credentials separate from the Rust launcher.

## Target profile: Yeti/Cachy

Yeti has an RTX 4070 with 12 GiB of VRAM, 64 GiB of RAM, and CUDA. The selected
profiles therefore use the smallest practical local variants:

- **MiniMax-H3:** audio.cpp `release-0.6`, the normal `minimax_h3_q4_k` GGUF
  package, staged/layerwise weights, memory saver, and a 32×32 audio-first
  default. `--video` switches to 832×480 and 121 frames (about five seconds at
  24 fps). The optional INT8 ConvRot DiT is not the default because the
  audio.cpp performance report measured a higher peak-memory path for it.
- **LTX-2.5:** the official 22B distilled BF16 transformer, quantized to FP8
  while loading with `fp8-cast`, plus CPU offload. The convolutional video VAE
  avoids requiring the diffusion-VAE attention extra.
- **HeartMuLa:** audio.cpp `release-0.6` with the published Q8_0 GGUF package,
  CUDA, and memory saver. This replaces the hosted MiniMax Music API profile
  with an offline lyrics/tags-to-song path.

These are conservative starting points, not a claim that every route will fit
or be fast on a 12 GiB card. Keep llama-swap's GPU model unloaded while running
H3, HeartMuLa, or LTX and start with five-second clips.

## Install and inspect

On Yeti, from the deployed L3MS checkout:

```bash
./maintenance/setup-media-runtimes.sh install-audio-cpp
./maintenance/setup-media-runtimes.sh install-ltx
./maintenance/setup-media-runtimes.sh install-music
./maintenance/setup-media-runtimes.sh check
```

`install-audio-cpp` clones the pinned `release-0.6` branch, builds the CUDA
CLI/server for `minimax_h3` and `heartmula`, and installs the public H3 Q4_K
and HeartMuLa Q8_0 packages under
`${L3MS_MEDIA_ROOT:-$HOME/models/media}`. `install-music` is an idempotent alias
for this shared build/install path. It does not touch llama-swap or port 8080.
On CachyOS it discovers `/opt/cuda` even from a non-interactive SSH shell and
pins the compatible CCCL 3.2 fetch needed by audio.cpp release-0.6.

LTX-2.5 is a gated Hugging Face model. Accept the model terms and log in with a
Read-scoped token, then opt into the roughly 66 GiB download:

```bash
export HF_TOKEN='…'        # kept in the shell environment, never committed
LTX_DOWNLOAD=1 ./maintenance/setup-media-runtimes.sh install-ltx
```

The script downloads only the files needed by the distilled wrapper: the
transformer, Gemma 4 projection encoder, convolutional video VAE, audio VAE,
and spatial upscaler. If authentication is not ready, `install-ltx` still sets
up the checkout and reports the missing gated files.

The official LTX-2.5 repository currently lists BF16 split components and its
official pipeline documents load-time `fp8-cast`. Web/model-registry checks on
2026-08-15 did not find an official pre-quantized Ada checkpoint. A newly
reported 22B distilled NVFP4 transformer is about 18.7 GB before runtime
overhead and targets Blackwell's native NVFP4 path (`SM >= 10`), so it is not
a viable RTX 4070 12 GB selection. Yeti therefore keeps the BF16 source file,
stores eligible transformer linears in FP8 during inference, and offloads to
CPU. If a compatible artifact is released later, pass `--transformer PATH`
with its matching `--quantization` policy after validating it against the
official `ltx-pipelines` loader.

## CLI usage

List the profiles without contacting llama-swap:

```bash
cargo run --locked -- --list media
```

Run a profile interactively, optionally filtering the picker:

```bash
cargo run --locked -- --media h3
cargo run --locked -- --media ltx
cargo run --locked -- --media music
```

The wrappers use argv-safe `--extra` values. Prompts, lyrics, and local file
paths remain one argument and are never evaluated as shell code.

MiniMax-H3 audio-first music/audio:

```bash
cargo run --locked -- --media minimax-h3 --extra \
  '--prompt "slow modular synth arpeggio, warm tape saturation" --steps 20'
```

MiniMax-H3 short video with synchronized audio (writes a playable MP4 when
`ffmpeg`, `jq`, and `xxd` are installed, while retaining the raw RGB24 JSON):

```bash
cargo run --locked -- --media minimax-h3 --extra \
  '--prompt "a rainy neon street, locked camera, reflections in puddles" --video'
```

Computer-assisted prompt input can use a local file instead of shell quoting:

```bash
cargo run --locked -- --media minimax-h3 --extra \
  '--prompt-file ./prompt.txt --video --video-output ./rainy-street.mp4'
```

The same `--prompt-file` option is available on LTX-2.5 and HeartMuLa;
HeartMuLa also accepts `--lyrics-file` for a locally authored lyric sheet.

LTX-2.5 text-to-video/audio:

```bash
cargo run --locked -- --media ltx-2.5 --extra \
  '--prompt "a paper boat crosses a puddle as thunder rolls in" --frames 121'
```

LTX-2.5 image-conditioned video (the image is passed as data, not shell code):

```bash
cargo run --locked -- --media ltx-2.5 --extra \
  '--prompt "the camera slowly pushes toward the boat" --image ./boat.png 0 0.8 --frames 121'
```

Local Q8_0 HeartMuLa music:

```bash
cargo run --locked -- --media heartmula-music --extra \
  '--prompt "dreamy ambient electronica with a gentle pulse" --instrumental'
cargo run --locked -- --media heartmula-music --extra \
  '--prompt "upbeat indie pop" --tags "pop,bright,drums,vocal" --lyrics-file ./lyrics.txt'
```

The default output directory is `$HOME/media-output`; set
`L3MS_MEDIA_OUTPUT_DIR` or pass `--output` to choose another destination.

## Inputs and computer-assisted workflows

The profiles expose text-file and lyrics-file inputs for computer-assisted
workflows, plus still-image conditioning for the LTX DistilledPipeline. H3's
official model family is multimodal, but the local audio.cpp `FL2VA` package
currently exposes the text-to-audio/video route only. LTX image paths use
explicit `--image PATH FRAME STRENGTH` triples; audio-to-video and
video-to-video work still require their corresponding upstream LTX pipeline and
model assets.

This keeps computer-use workflows safe: a UI or notebook can write a prompt or
lyrics file and invoke `l3ms --media … --extra …`, while local paths are passed
as data. No browser automation or API key is required by L3MS itself.

  practical advice to start at low resolution with substantial system RAM and
  expect multi-minute generation. Reddit is treated as field evidence, not as
  the source of runtime flags or model compatibility claims.
- A newer 12 GB H3 report gives a useful planning baseline: roughly 864×480,
  124 frames, and 20 steps completed in under nine minutes with 32 GB system
  RAM. Other reports describe reference-video/audio paths stalling or crashing
  on 12 GB, so this L3MS profile intentionally keeps inputs text-first and
  exposes still-image conditioning only where the selected runtime supports it.
